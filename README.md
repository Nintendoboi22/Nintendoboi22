- Â Random Fact:
- Â  Â 1. The reason why my links are so long is that teachers have to type all of that in to block it (hopefully).
Â  Â  Â 2. Each game is a different repo it is easier to fork, idk
Â  Â  Â 3. i dont like to use the term "Unblocked Games", its just a game, I mean yes, it is unblocked, but the less codeworks the better. (asides from github)
- Â Pronouns: he/him
- [I made my own game website](https://nintendoboi22.github.io)
