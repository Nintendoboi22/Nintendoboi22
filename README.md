     1. The reason why my links are so long is that teachers have to type all of that in to block it (hopefully).\
Â       2. Each game is a different repo it is easier to fork, idk\
Â  Â  Â      3. I dont like to use the term "Unblocked Games", its just a game, I mean yes, it is unblocked, but the less codeworks the better. (asides from github tags)
